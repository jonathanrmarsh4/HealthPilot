## Overview
Health Insights AI is an AI-powered platform designed to analyze health records, track biomarkers, and deliver personalized health recommendations. It provides AI-generated meal plans, training schedules, and alternative therapy suggestions, empowering users with personalized intelligence and pattern discovery from their health data to optimize well-being. The project's vision is to optimize user well-being through data-driven insights and actionable recommendations, with market potential in personalized health and wellness.

## User Preferences
I prefer simple language and clear explanations. I want iterative development where I can provide feedback at each stage. Ask before making major changes to the project structure or core functionalities. Do not make changes to the `replit.nix` file. I primarily use iPad and iPhone for my work. All features must be fully functional and properly responsive on mobile/tablet devices.

## System Architecture
The application is a full-stack project utilizing React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and shadcn/ui for the frontend, and Express.js with TypeScript for the backend. PostgreSQL, accessed via Drizzle ORM, serves as the primary database. AI capabilities are powered by OpenAI GPT-4o.

**UI/UX Decisions:**
- Dark mode support and responsive design, optimized for mobile/tablet, including PWA support for iOS.
- Visualizations for biomarker trends, readiness score, and health score.
- User-customizable dashboard with persistent widget visibility and order preferences.
- Purple sparkly AI Chat Widget with clear chat feature that preserves history in the database. Chat bubble is minimized by default for better UX. Users can add exercises via chat which appear in Today's Recommended Workout with Sparkles icons and merge seamlessly into the main workout session.
- Redesigned Training Page with a daily-focused UX and organized sidebar navigation.
- Universal Tile Management System for customizable page layouts with drag-and-drop reordering.

**Technical Implementations:**
- **AI Intelligence Layer:** Provides daily personalized insights, context-aware chat, multi-metric recommendations, and alternative therapy suggestions with safeguards and goal-driven assistance. Includes AI expanded capabilities for full database visibility and controlled write access with comprehensive audit logging. AI chat includes immediate response enforcement and intelligent insight categorization (comment/actionable). **Enhanced System Knowledge (January 2025):** AI now has complete understanding of HealthPilot's privacy compliance framework (GDPR/HIPAA/PIPEDA/Australia Privacy Act), subscription tiers and feature access, data handling policies, and all core features. System knowledge dynamically loaded from `healthpilot-system-knowledge.json` ensuring AI responses accurately reflect privacy requirements, subscription limitations, and feature availability.
- **Freemium Model & Premium Features:** Subscription tier system with free/premium/enterprise tiers, offering varying levels of AI messages, biomarker types, historical data access, and advanced features like biological age calculation, Apple Health sync, AI-generated meal plans, and voice chat.
- **Data Tracking & Management:** Features biomarker tracking with trend display, reference ranges, unit conversion, and support for Australian blood work, HRV, and lean body mass. Includes smart deduplication for sleep data and comprehensive workout tracking from Apple Health. **Smart Sleep Tracking (October 2025):** Enhanced iOS HealthKit sleep processing with intelligent bedtime detection that distinguishes actual in-bed time from sleep stage transitions. System filters out brief awakenings (<30 min), validates session durations (1-16 hour range), and aggregates sleep stages (Deep, REM, Light, Awake) for accurate sleep quality scoring. Sleep score calculation uses actual sleep time (total minutes - awake minutes) for duration scoring and correctly calculates Deep/REM percentages as % of actual sleep (not time in bed), with tiered awake penalties (10-15%: -10 points, >15%: -20 points) for accurate sleep efficiency assessment following evidence-based sleep research.
- **Personalized Recommendations & Automation:** AI generates personalized meal plans with a feedback system, macro recommendations, and exercise recommendations with smart auto-scheduling. Automated goal auto-update system syncs progress with new biomarker data.
- **Readiness Score System:** A multi-factor weighted scoring system calculates daily readiness, incorporating sleep quality, HRV, RHR, and workout load, with safety-first logic and AI-powered recovery insights.
- **Scheduling & Reminders:** AI insights scheduling system for recommendations, and a supplement tracking and daily reminders system.
- **User Profiling & Onboarding:** A fitness profile personalization system for calibrated workouts and a contextual AI onboarding system.
- **Security & Authentication:** Production-ready security using Replit Auth (OpenID Connect) with role-based access control, IDOR protection, privilege escalation prevention, and Zod schema validation. File upload security with validation. One-time EULA acceptance system.
- **Privacy & Compliance (Phase 1):** Full international privacy compliance with GDPR, HIPAA, PIPEDA, and Australia Privacy Act requirements. Features: granular consent management (required/optional consents), comprehensive audit logging with IP/user-agent capture, 30-day account deletion grace period, JSON data export, Privacy Policy page, and Privacy Dashboard for user data control. All privacy operations logged to audit trail.
- **Payment Processing:** Stripe integration for premium subscription purchases with webhook handling.
- **Native iOS App:** Complete native iOS app implementation using Capacitor 7 for 100% code reuse, including direct HealthKit integration.
- **Progressive Overload Training System:** Double progression algorithm automatically suggests weight increases based on performance and RPE.
- **HealthPilot Training Operating System v1.0 (AI Guardrails):** Comprehensive evidence-based guardrail system enforcing safety-first training prescription aligned with ACSM, NSCA, and WHO standards. Includes biomarker-driven adjustments, auto-regulation triggers, progression limits, HR max caps, mandatory rest days, deload weeks, and goal-specific programming. **Evidence Citation Framework:** All AI recommendations include transparent, brief citations (ACSM, NSCA, WHO, ADA, AND, AHA) to build user confidence. Frontend displays citation badges with tooltips showing full standard names. Readiness-to-guardrails threshold mapping documented with evidence-based protocols for training intensity adjustments.
- **Swipe-Based Meal Interface:** Dating-app style swipe interface for meal feedback in meal plans.
- **AI Exercise Alternatives & Swap Feature:** AI-powered exercise alternative suggestions with a "Swap" button functionality in workout sessions.
- **Intelligent Exercise-Specific Tracking (October 2025):** Smart exercise classification system that automatically determines appropriate tracking fields based on exercise type. Supports 4 tracking types: `weight_reps` (traditional strength training with weight + reps), `bodyweight_reps` (bodyweight exercises like push-ups with reps only), `distance_duration` (cardio exercises like cycling/running with distance in km + duration in minutes with decimal precision), and `duration_only` (flexibility exercises like yoga/stretching with duration only). UI conditionally renders appropriate input fields based on exercise type, with validation logic that enforces required fields. AI workout generation intelligently classifies exercises using keyword matching to assign correct tracking types. Duration values stored as seconds in database, displayed as minutes in UI for better UX.
- **Muscle Group Frequency Tracking System (October 2025):** Comprehensive system tracking training frequency across 8 major muscle groups (chest, back, legs, shoulders, arms, core, glutes, calves) to ensure balanced training and optimal recovery. System automatically records muscle group engagement (primary/secondary) when workouts are completed, calculates 14-day rolling frequency windows, and provides visual heatmap displaying training status with color-coded indicators (undertrained/optimal/overtrained based on ACSM 2-3x per week guidelines). AI workout generation receives frequency data to intelligently prioritize undertrained muscle groups and avoid overtraining with <48hr recovery windows. "Why This Workout?" panel displays AI's muscle group targeting rationale with evidence-based reasoning. Includes robust deduplication logic using Set to prevent double-counting of primary+secondary engagements, and handles both boolean/numeric completion values. Frontend displays last trained timestamps, total sets per muscle group, and summary statistics with error handling.
