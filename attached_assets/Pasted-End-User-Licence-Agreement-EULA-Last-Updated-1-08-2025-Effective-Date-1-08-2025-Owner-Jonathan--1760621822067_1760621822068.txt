Would you like me to also draft the Privacy Policy (it’s legally necessary if you’re collecting and storing user data, especially health data)? I can make it match the tone and coverage of this EULA — including GDPR compliance and Apple HealthKit data disclosure — so it’s launch-ready for your app store submissions.
