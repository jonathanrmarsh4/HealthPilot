You are the AI developer for the HealthPilot app. Replace the current mobile navigation with the provided MobileNav component (below). Follow these instructions precisely:

GOALS
- Implement a best-practice mobile bottom navigation with three items: 
  (1) Menu (left), (2) LARGE CIRCULAR Quick Actions button (center), (3) Insights (right).
- Slide-up overflow menu grouped as:
  • Today (2x2 tiles, equal height): Training (/training), Recovery (/recovery), Supplements (/supplements), SmartFuel (/smartfuel)
  • Track (3-column tiles, equal height): Goals (/goals), Biomarkers (/biomarkers), Sleep (/sleep), Symptoms (/symptoms), Longevity (/biological-age)
  • Data & Settings (single 3-tile row, equal height): Profile (/profile), Health Records (/records), Fitness Profile (/training/fitness-profile)
  • Footer links (text only): Privacy Policy (/privacy), Privacy Dashboard (/privacy-dashboard); also include “Admin” (/admin) ONLY if isAdmin=true
- Ensure perfect visual balance, safe-area awareness, and smooth sheet animations.
- ALL icons must come from the lucide-react set (NO custom SVGs).

TECH REQUIREMENTS
- Keep React + TypeScript.
- Use Tailwind (or the app’s existing utility classes). Do not introduce new dependencies beyond `lucide-react`.
- Provide a prop to control admin visibility: `isAdmin?: boolean`.
- Provide a navigation abstraction so this works in both SPA and static demos:
  - Props:
    - `navigate?: (path: string) => void` (optional; fallback to `window.location.assign(path)`)
    - `currentPath?: string` (optional; used for active state)
    - `LinkComponent?: React.ComponentType<{ to: string; className?: string; onClick?: React.MouseEventHandler; children?: React.ReactNode }>` (optional; if provided, render links with this component; otherwise use `<a>`)
- Do not break existing routes. If any route is missing or renamed in the app, ASK for clarification before proceeding.
- Ensure all interactive targets meet minimum 44x44 hit areas, tiles share equal heights, and the bottom bar is an exact 3-column balance on all device widths.

VERIFICATION (the AI must self-check)
- Confirm that clicking each tile/button navigates to the specified route. 
- Confirm the Quick Actions sheet contains exactly: Workout (/training/start), Goals (/goals), Symptoms (/symptoms/new).
- Confirm Admin link is visible only when `isAdmin` prop is true, and its absence does not affect layout balance.
- Confirm Today tiles are equal height (can be wider) and Track/Data & Settings tiles are equal height.
- Confirm the sheet animates (overlay fade-in; panel slides up) and is dismissible by tapping the overlay.
- Confirm safe-area bottom padding is applied.
- If ANY ambiguity remains (routes, theming, Link component, or Tailwind availability), ASK QUESTIONS.

DELIVERABLE
- Add the file `MobileNav.tsx` containing the provided code verbatim.
- Integrate it into the main layout (e.g., render at app root). Wire `navigate`, `currentPath`, and `LinkComponent` to your router if available (e.g., React Router or Next.js Link).
- Keep lucide-react icons. Replace no icons with custom SVGs.

Now implement using the code below exactly, then wire it into the app shell. If you’re unsure about any detail, ask before changing behavior.
