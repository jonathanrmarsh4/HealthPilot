Perfect — that gives you just under 12 months, which is ideal for a safe, progressive, and enjoyable prep for Kokoda. Given you’re already fit and healthy, we can focus on building endurance, leg strength, core stability, and hiking-specific conditioning — while also managing recovery and injury prevention for your age bracket.
🏔️ Goal
Be physically and mentally prepared to hike 96 km of rugged terrain over 8–10 days, carrying a pack (~8–12 kg), in high humidity and steep gradients.
🗓️ Training Phases (Oct 2025 → Oct 2026)
Phase 1: Base Conditioning (Oct 2025 – Dec 2025, 12 weeks)
Goal: Build aerobic base and general strength.
Focus: Low-intensity endurance, functional gym work, mobility.
Weekly Plan
2× Hikes: 5–10 km easy trails with light pack (<5 kg)
2× Strength sessions:
Squats, lunges, step-ups, Romanian deadlifts
Core (planks, side planks, hanging leg raises)
Upper body (push-ups, pull-ups, rows)
1× Cross-training: Cycling, swimming, or rowing 30–45 min
1× Mobility/Stretch session (yoga or functional movement)
Phase 2: Strength & Endurance Build (Jan – Mar 2026, 12 weeks)
Goal: Improve lower-body and core strength, increase pack time.
Focus: Hill climbs, heavier pack, and controlled load increase.
Weekly Plan
1× Long hike: 12–18 km, with elevation gain 500–800 m, pack ~ 8 kg
1× Hill repeats or stair training: 6–8 × 3 min climbs
2× Gym: Heavier leg work (deadlifts, step-ups with dumbbells, Bulgarian splits), loaded carries, core
1× Cardio recovery: Zone-2 cycle or swim
1× Mobility or yoga
Phase 3: Hiking Specific (Apr – Jul 2026, 16 weeks)
Goal: Simulate trail conditions and volume; adapt to load and fatigue.
Focus: Back-to-back hikes, terrain variation, mental resilience.
Weekly Plan
1× Long hike: 18–25 km, rough terrain, pack 10–12 kg
1× Back-to-back hike: Sat/Sun 10 km + 15 km (train recovery under fatigue)
1× Hill or stairs: Weighted climbs, 30–45 min continuous
1× Strength maintenance: Full-body circuit, lighter weights
1× Active recovery: Swimming, yoga, or massage
💡 Optional: Add treadmill incline hikes midweek (10–15 %) when weather is bad.
Phase 4: Expedition Simulation (Aug – Sep 2026, 8 weeks)
Goal: Replicate Kokoda conditions.
Focus: Altitude simulation (if possible), heat acclimation, pack load.
Weekly Plan
1× Multi-day hike or overnight camp: 2–3 days, total 40–50 km
1× Long hike: 25–30 km, pack 12 kg
1× Stairs or hill climbs: 45 min + with pack
1× Gym: Core, stability, band work, single-leg strength
1× Mobility/Recovery: Stretch, sauna, cold plunge
Practice with:
Trail nutrition & hydration
Foot care (blister prevention, socks, boots)
Mental fatigue management
Phase 5: Taper & Travel Prep (Oct 2026, 2–3 weeks)
Goal: Recover, stay sharp, travel ready.
Focus: Light activity, no overload.
Reduce volume by 40–50 %
2–3 light hikes, short hill sessions
Sleep, hydration, massage, and packing dry runs
🥾 Equipment Adaptation Plan
Begin hiking in your actual boots by Jan 2026.
Progress pack weight gradually (start 5 kg → 12 kg by Sep 2026).
Include rain, heat, and mud conditions where possible.
Use trekking poles — they’ll save your knees.
💪 Strength Focus (Key Lifts)
Movement	Target	Purpose
Step-Ups (weighted)	3×12 ea leg	Mimics uphill hiking
Walking Lunges	3×20	Endurance strength
Romanian Deadlift	3×10	Posterior chain
Goblet Squats	3×15	Core + legs
Plank → Side Plank	3×60 s each	Core stability
Farmer’s Carry	3×40 m	Pack stability
🧠 Mindset & Recovery
Hike in bad weather sometimes — it builds resilience.
Practice sleeping rough.
Track HRV and recovery to prevent overtraining.
Monthly massage or physio check-ins.
Keep protein high (1.6–2 g/kg/day).
🩺 Health & Monitoring
Schedule GP check and ECG before heavy load training.
Track blood pressure weekly during high training blocks.
Manage knees and Achilles carefully — these are common injury zones for Kokoda hikers 50+.
Would you like me to turn this into a downloadable 12-month spreadsheet plan with weekly progress tracking (km, elevation, pack weight, recovery notes)? It’ll make it much easier to follow and adapt as you go.
