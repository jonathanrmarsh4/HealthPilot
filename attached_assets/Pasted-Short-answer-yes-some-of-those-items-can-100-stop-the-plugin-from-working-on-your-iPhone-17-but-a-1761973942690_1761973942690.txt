Short answer: yes—some of those items can 100% stop the plugin from working on your iPhone 17, but a few are just “quality” fixes that wouldn’t cause the "not implemented on ios" error.
Will block the plugin entirely (matches your symptom)
These can make Capacitor say the plugin isn’t implemented even though it builds:
Dynamic framework dead-stripping / registration not loaded
If the .m with CAP_PLUGIN(...) isn’t pulled into the App target at runtime, the bridge won’t see your plugin. The fixes we gave—static framework in the podspec, -ObjC in OTHER_LDFLAGS for the App target, and (belt-and-braces) the force-loader ping—directly address this. Any one of these missing can cause your exact error on an iPhone 17.
Wrong TS/JS plugin name vs native registration
Must be an exact match across all three places:
CAP_PLUGIN(HealthPilotHealthKit, "HealthPilotHealthKit", …) ↔ @objc(HealthPilotHealthKit) ↔ registerPlugin('HealthPilotHealthKit'). A mismatch causes the same “not implemented” error.
Podfile hacks that fight CocoaPods
Custom OTHER_LDFLAGS << '-framework HealthPilotHealthKit' or global use_frameworks! (dynamic) can allow the build to pass but still prevent the Obj-C registration from loading at runtime.
Won’t cause “not implemented”, but can break/crash after registration
These are important, but they don’t explain your current log:
Force-unwrap of new HK types (e.g., waistCircumference) → would crash on older iOS, but iPhone 17 (iOS 18) supports them, so not your current blocker.
Calling auth off main thread → may cause flaky permission UI, but not “not implemented”.
Blood glucose unit choice, unsorted/no-limit queries, perf issues → correctness/perf problems later, not a registration failure.
Quick on-device sanity checks (takes 2 minutes)
In Xcode Build Log, confirm you see Compile HealthPilotHealthKit.m. If not, the source isn’t included.
In the App target’s Build Settings → Other Linker Flags, confirm -ObjC is present (Release & Debug).
With the force-loader in place, set a breakpoint in ForceLoadHealthPilotHealthKit.loadPlugin()—ensure it runs on launch.
From JS, call await HealthPilotHealthKit.isAvailable() immediately after launch; if it throws, registration still hasn’t happened.
Bottom line
On an iPhone 17 specifically, the registration/linkage items (static framework, -ObjC, and/or force-loader) are the ones that explain why you can’t get the plugin working. Fix those first; the other code fixes are to prevent crashes or bad data once the plugin is visible.
