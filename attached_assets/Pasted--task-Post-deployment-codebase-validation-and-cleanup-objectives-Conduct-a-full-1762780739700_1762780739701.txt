  "task": "Post-deployment codebase validation and cleanup",
  "objectives": [
    "Conduct a full code review of the current project after the latest fix or feature integration.",
    "Ensure there are no syntax errors, console warnings, or TypeScript validation issues.",
    "Check for broken imports, unused dependencies, outdated packages, or circular references.",
    "Verify that all internal and external links, routes, and API endpoints resolve correctly.",
    "Run automated linting and static analysis — confirm adherence to ESLint, Prettier, and project coding standards.",
    "Test for UI/UX consistency in all screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile) and confirm no layout shifts or padding anomalies.",
    "Perform dependency integrity check (npm/yarn lockfiles, Capacitor/iOS modules, etc.) and resolve mismatches.",
    "Identify and remove any unused or deprecated code, assets, images, or readme fragments left over from earlier versions.",
    "Validate that the current build runs cleanly in dev and production modes with zero build warnings.",
    "Prepare a concise report outlining issues found, fixes applied, and potential future conflicts or optimizations."
  ],
  "actions": [
    "Run a static code analysis using TypeScript compiler checks and project linter.",
    "Execute a simulated build (or dry-run) to detect runtime or dependency errors.",
    "Automatically patch or refactor minor issues (typos, redundant code, etc.) and confirm the build passes.",
    "For major issues, describe root cause and suggest the minimal, safest fix without breaking current functionality.",
    "Confirm compatibility with latest Capacitor, React, and iOS SDK versions."
  ],
  "verification_gates": [
    "No build or runtime errors.",
    "No unused imports or variables.",
    "No dead code or broken navigation links.",
    "All components load correctly across responsive breakpoints.",
    "No console warnings during runtime."
