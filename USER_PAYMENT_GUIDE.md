## Common Questions

### Is my payment information secure?
Yes. HealthPilot uses Stripe, which is PCI-DSS Level 1 certified (the highest security standard). Your card details are encrypted and never stored on HealthPilot servers.

### Will I be charged immediately?
Yes, when you subscribe to Premium, you'll be charged immediately and receive access right away.

### Can I switch from monthly to annual billing?
Currently, only monthly billing is available. Annual billing may be added in the future.

### Do you offer refunds?
Contact support at support@nuvitaelabs.com to discuss refunds on a case-by-case basis within 7 days of purchase.

### What happens to my data if I downgrade to Free?
All your data is preserved. However, you'll only be able to:
- Send 15 AI messages per month (message history is saved)
- View your 10 most recent biomarkers
- Access the last 30 days of historical data

Your other data remains in your account and becomes accessible again if you resubscribe to Premium.

### Can I upgrade/downgrade during my billing cycle?
Yes. When upgrading, you're charged a prorated amount for the remainder of the month. When downgrading, the change takes effect at the end of your current billing period.

### I'm having trouble with payment - who do I contact?
For payment issues:
1. Check that your card details are correct in the Stripe portal
2. Contact your bank to ensure they're not blocking the charge
3. Email support@nuvitaelabs.com with details of the issue

### Can I get an invoice for my company?
Yes. After each payment, Stripe automatically sends an invoice. You can add company details (name, tax ID, address) in the Billing portal under "Update information" and they'll appear on future invoices.
